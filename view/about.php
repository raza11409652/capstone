          <p class="intro">Moz started up in 2004, and we’ve been on an epic ride ever since. From our beginnings as an SEO consulting company to launching the first Pro app in 2007, we’ve tried to stay true to our core beliefs—TAGFEE—and to deliver an exceptional experience for our community and subscribers. We owe a huge thanks to our community for joining us on this awesome journey, and we hope that you’ll continue to be a part of our story.</p>
          <p class="intro">Our co-founder, Rand Fishkin, has always put the T (for transparency) in TAGFEE. Read his personal thoughts about Moz on his blog. <a href="/rand/">Read&nbsp;Rand's&nbsp;Blog</a></p>
